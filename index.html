			"Kevin Murphy has distilled the vast and confusing literature on machine learning and neural networks
			into a beautifully written 
			and extremely clear textbook that will be a wonderful resource for both new students 
			and seasoned researchers who are trying to keep up with this fast moving field.  
			The chapter on generative models is a masterpiece."
